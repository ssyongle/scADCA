Introduction
   scADCA is a cell type annotation framework that can identify novel cells. Based on anomaly detection, we first identify the existence of novel cells, and then complete the whole annotation of the query dataset.
Instructions
  The implementation code of the simulation and real datasets (corresponding to Dataset2 in the article) is given, please refer to simulation dataset.ipynb and real dataset.ipynb.
